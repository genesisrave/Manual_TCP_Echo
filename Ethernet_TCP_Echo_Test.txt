		*   ETHERNET - TCP ECHO TEST   *
		********************************

===================
Setup Requirements:
===================
	- Vx Terminal with Ethernet Support
	- Simple Server
		
==================
Vx Terminal Setup:
==================
	- Vx Terminal must be loaded in the latest EOS package.
	- Connect Vx Terminal to a network same with the Host PC

=============================	
Test Application Requirement:
=============================
	- Modify makefile to indicate the correct EOS SDK file directory.
	- Compile test application in the following folders
	- Modify ETH_PORT in ZontalkNet.dld to Ethernet Device. 
		1 - DEV_ETH1
		2 - DEV_ETH2
		Default is DEV_ETH1
		
===============================	
Simple Server Application Setup
===============================
	- Run Simple Server on Host PC. (For Windows 7 PC, run this as Administrator).
	- Input Host PC IP Address in Interface field
	- Input Host Port Number in Endpoint field. This should be the same with the PORTNUM variable in Tcp_Echo.DLD
	- Input TCP in Protocol field.
	- Press START Button. There should be no error displayed in the server. 
	- There server should now display "Listening on port <endpoint>, protocol TCP" 	
			

***********************	
*   Test Procedure:   *
***********************

1. Modify HOSTIP variable in TCP_ECHO.DLD for the HOST PC IP Address.
2. Modify PORTNUM variable in TCP_ECHO.DLD for Host PC port. This should be the same with the Endpoint field in Simple Server App.
	- Suggested PORTNUM values are 5001 to 5015.
3. Make sure terminal and Host PC are in the SAME Network.
4. Execute Run_TCP_Echo.bat to download application.
5. Capture log.
6. Let the application run.
7. The application will run for 100 loops. Data sent will be 512, 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096, 5120, 6144 and 8192 bytes. 
8. There should be no error logged. No Fail count after the test is completed.
